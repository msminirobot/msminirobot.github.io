I’m the head of the <a href="https://www.utn.de/en/departments/department-engineering/artificial-intelligence-and-robotics-lab/#satellite-lab">Multi-Robot Systems Satellite Lab</a> and a senior researcher at the University of Technology Nuremberg, Germany. My research interests are multi-robot systems, evolutionary robotics, and embodied AI. 

Previously, I was the Ada Lovelace Distinguished Research Fellow at the Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence at Technische Universität Dresden, Germany, and a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.cps.uni-konstanz.de">Cyber-Physical Systems Group</a> and an affiliate member of the <a href="https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/">Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour</a> at the Universität Konstanz, Germany. I completed my doctorate in the <a href="https://www.iti.uni-luebeck.de">Service Robotics Group</a> at the Universität zu Lübeck, Germany.
