I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.uni-konstanz.de">University Konstanz (Germany)</a> in the <a href="https://www.cps.uni-konstanz.de">Cyber-Physical Systems Group</a> headed by <a href="http://heikohamann.de">Prof. Dr.-Ing. Heiko Hamann</a>.
My research interests are <b>swarm robotics</b>, <b>collective systems</b>, and <b>evolutionary robotics</b>. 

In 2022, I defended my doctoral dissertation titled "The Predicting Swarm: Evolving Collective Behaviors for Robot Swarms by Minimizing Surprise" at the <a href="https://www.uni-luebeck.de/">University of LÃ¼beck (Germany)</a>. 
I was member of the Service Robotics Group headed by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Heiko Hamann as part of the <a href="https://www.iti.uni-luebeck.de">Institute of Computer Engineering</a>.

Furthermore, I hold a M. Sc. degree in Computer Science of the <a href="https://www.tu-berlin.de">Technical University Berlin (Germany)</a> and a B. Sc. in Applied Computer Science of the <a href="https://www.dhbw-stuttgart.de">Cooperative State University Baden-Wuerttemberg Stuttgart (Germany)</a>.
